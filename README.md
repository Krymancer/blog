# Blog

I really needed to starting writing something so I figured that a blog would be a good idea.

## Information

I'm using hugo in this, is a nice tool, I can write it in markdown and will generate the website. I never remember the commands so I wrote them here.

Run server locally

> hugo server

Go to the changes

> hugo server --navigateToChanged

Build and deploy

> hugo
