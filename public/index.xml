      <description>Introduction I recently took on a challenge to build my own JSON parser in Rust. This project was a fantastic opportunity to dive deep into parsing techniques, which are crucial for everything from simple data formats to building compilers. You can find the full details of the challenge here and the source code in my GitHub repository.&#xA;The Challenge The challenge was structured to incrementally build a JSON parser, starting with simple JSON objects and progressively handling more complex structures.</description>

      <description>I found myself not really excited to code anything and that was really bothering me. I was always excited to code something, learning something new and not being able to enjoy it or have the motivation to do it was really driving me crazy.

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s this event, which is conceived by Zanfranceschi. Essentially, Zan gave us a specification that we followed to implement an API. For this first quarter edition of 2024, we have a kind of &amp;ldquo;Bank&amp;rdquo; where some pre-registered clients check their statements and make transactions. If you want to read more details, I invite you to take a look at the repository of the event, where you can find the specifications along with the rest of the participation instructions and related information.</description>
