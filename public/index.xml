      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in my journey of trying to learn zig on one of those days when I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get myself to sleep I thought, why not make a game using zig? Yes, the question is always &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo; and the answer is always &amp;ldquo;why not?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So another one of my phases began, I started looking into some lib or anything that I cloud make an 2d game, I was thinking in using &lt;a href=&#34;https://libsdl.org/&#34;&gt;SDL&lt;/a&gt; as I already use it in the past with C++, but I remembered &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raylib.com/index.html&#34;&gt;raylib&lt;/a&gt; and found out about &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Not-Nik/raylib-zig&#34;&gt;raylib-zig&lt;/a&gt; and was an sign for me to start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently took on a challenge to build my own JSON parser in Rust. This project was a fantastic opportunity to dive deep into parsing techniques, which are crucial for everything from simple data formats to building compilers. You can find the full details of the challenge &lt;a href=&#34;https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-json-parser&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the source code in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Krymancer/cc-json-parser&#34;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-challenge&#34;&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge was structured to incrementally build a JSON parser, starting with simple JSON objects and progressively handling more complex structures. Here&amp;rsquo;s a step-by-step breakdown of the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found myself not really excited to code anything and that was really bothering me. I was always excited to code something, learning something new and not being able to enjoy it or have the motivation to do it was really driving me crazy. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what was the cause but I can&amp;rsquo;t do anytthing, I felt like I was justing being lazy, tried to read a book, or take a time for myself but nothing really helped. So I started to serching for a new project that I cloud make and be excited about, nothing really caught my eye, same basic projects as aways, frontend projects are either too simple or have some gimmic that I didn&amp;rsquo;t really care at the moment, backend projects are always CRUD at this point. I was really lost, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do, I was really sad about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My First Zig API</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s this event, which is conceived by Zanfranceschi. Essentially, Zan gave us a specification that we followed to implement an API. For this first quarter edition of 2024, we have a kind of &amp;ldquo;Bank&amp;rdquo; where some pre-registered clients check their statements and make transactions. If you want to read more details, I invite you to take a look at the repository of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zanfranceschi/rinha-de-backend-2024-q1&#34;&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;, where you can find the specifications along with the rest of the participation instructions and related information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
