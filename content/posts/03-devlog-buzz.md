Back in my journey of trying to learn zig on one of those days when I couldn't get myself to sleep I thought, why not make a game using zig? Yes, the question is always "why?" and the answer is always "why not?"

So another one of my phases began, I started looking into some lib or anything that I cloud make an 2d game, I was thinking in using [SDL](https://libsdl.org/) as I already use it in the past with C++, but I remembered [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/index.html) and found out about [raylib-zig](https://github.com/Not-Nik/raylib-zig) and was an sign for me to start.

I don't remember how much thought I put in the game idea, but I come up with and management game where you have to try and keep the game running for the most time you can. I was aiming for something simple, both to play and to implement. So I come up with buzzness-tyccon
