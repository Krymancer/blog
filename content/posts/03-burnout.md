Ins't news that OpenAI released ChatGPT into the wild of the internet and it become the most rapidly used product ever (don't check me on that I cloud be wrong). People started using it for everything and I mean everything. I saw it in websites, I saw it in software and products that really don't beneficiate even a little bit in having all might "AI".

I'ts almost impossible now days getting support for a product because of the chat bots that don't help at all, a FAQ would be better, cost less and don't harm the environment as much. I decided to write this after I read [this incredible post](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/01/02/the-i-in-llm-stands-for-intelligence/) by Daniel Stenberg. You might already know what it is and where this is going.

## The I in LLM stands for intelligence

Most people don't know but Chat GPT and others tools like it, don't actually think. They are programs that given the input will choose words based on how much likely it will be the "best" next word. In a nutshell it don't even know at words, phrases or anything mean, it only know that in the absurd amount of data that is trained in is best to put certain words after others one.

This is the cause when you ask "How many r is in strawberry" you wound get the correct answer, it doesn't know what words you put in it, every word is a number and some numbers like to be together. (I am oversimplifying here but I do think you get the point).

## It is not ALL that

I guess is because I've been studying AI and computers for a long time that not everything really come to me as impressive to the average person. I won't say that Chat GPT isn't a great tool and isn't impressive. Because it is. But the noise that people did, the hype is too much, this was a breakthrough of how we use computers and the internet but the results are bad, so bad.

## Nothing exists anymore

With LLM existing and stable diffusing being able to generate images the is so much AI generated content in the word. Sometimes is hard to not see anything like this in the internet, people are lazy so they will ask for a LLM to do anything and don't even proof read. Oh well I saw people that wont even look at was generated. People don't search anymore.
I know I'm sounding like "Back in my days things are better" but I do think that the way we are going with LLM is wrong. This much brainless content that is just words on top of words is harmful. Shows already aren't great and imagine if the next ones being writed only by AI.

## AI is good

That being said I do think that AI is good and can help us achieve much more that we can imagine, but I don't think that the way is to use them to do things that we are great at and need to do, that is think. We need to write to read, to solve puzzles and think. Ours brains are addicted to being stimulated, that why is so hard to stop scrolling the brain rot social media these days, is like a drug. I think that we need to going back to do somethings that AI is taking from us, like writing and making art. AI is supposed to automate task that are boring to us have time to do something else that we are great at.
